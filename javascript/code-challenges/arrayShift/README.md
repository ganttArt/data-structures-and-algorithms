# Challenge Summary
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Shift Array - insert a value into the middle of an array

## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
time -> O(n)
space -> O(n)

I need to create a copy of the input array, plus one element, (time -> O(n)),  
by iterating through the input array (space -> O(n)).
